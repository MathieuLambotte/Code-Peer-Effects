# Codes-Peer-Effects
R Codes to estimate Peer Effects with different models, building on Lee, Li and Lin (2014)'s Binary Choice Models with Social Network under Heterogeneous Rational Expectation (https://doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00401) for the Simulated Iterative Maximum Likelihood estimator (SIML_LLL function in my code) and on Boucher and Bramoull√© 2020's Binary Outcomes and Linear Interactions (https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-03031767/document). \

This a work in progress, intended for my own research but someone might find it useful.
